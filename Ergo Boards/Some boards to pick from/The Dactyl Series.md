### What are they
The dactyl boards are a type of boards, similar to the Kinesis advantage, designed to comfortably fit a hand. To improve ergonomics, the boards have a scoop for the fingers to rest in as it is supposed to fit the shape of a hand better, though this is subjective.

They aren't something you just buy, though, they are a product type that you use parameters to customize and then 3D print and hand solder to create a completely custom board.

### How they are designed
You can find more simple generators where you tell the program what you want, or you can do it more crudely in a CAD program. You pass it parameters such as the key matrix size you want (rows and columns), number of keys in the thumb cluster, position of the thumb cluster, and many more.

You then take the model of the board and 3D print it, allowing you to insert the switches and then wire them up

### The hand wiring
Being sculpted boards, they obviously can't use a PCB, as PCBs can't yet be made curved (sort of), so to make the boards work, they must be hand wired.
This isn't particularly difficult, and there are plenty of simple tutorials to follow online as to how to do it effectively.
