### The Brand
ZSA is one of very few (comparatively) large ergo board manufacturers that has comprehensive software and very good customer support. For these and many other reasons, their boards are considered as endgame for a large number of people. 
### Oryx - the best software?
Oryx is ZSA's groundbreaking keyboard firmware development program. It allows users to use a simple UI to design their layout using small icons, then the program develops that into a QMK file that can be booted onto the keyboard. This seemingly simple software has surprisingly many features such as home row mods and tap dance, as well as allowing more layers than anyone would ever need.
### The Boards
ZSA have 3 boards: the Ergodox EZ, the Planck EZ, and the Moonlander.

The Ergodox EZ is ZSA's take on the fairly popular layout, the ergodox. It is a fairly large board, being roughly equivalent to a 60% standard board. It differers from most ergodoxes in that it has built in tenting feet which protrude from the case at adjustable angles alloing the user to customise the angle from 0⁰ to about 30-40⁰. 

The Planck EZ isn't anything special to be honest. It is just another planck. It doesnt have any special keys or rotary encoders or an oled panel, just a good old planck. The reason it's so popular then is a combination of 3 things: hotswap sockets, it's readily available, and the ability to use the oryx software with it.

The Moonlander is arguably ZSA's best board: it is a completely unique design and layout, and therefore creates and fills a hole in the market nicely. It is somewhat similar to the ergodox layout, although it has a more aggressive columnar stagger, allowing it to suit most hands more comfortably, and it uses just 4 thumb keys rather than the ergodoxes 6. This simplified, more ergonomic layout has clearly been a hit as it is ZSA's best selling board: it makes split layouts more manageable for beginners.
