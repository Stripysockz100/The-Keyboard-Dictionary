Stacked Acrylic cases are fairly self explanatory. They consist of layering sheets of acrylic, cut to the correct size and shape normally with a laser-cutter, to build up the case, and then often using screws or bolts, attaching the layers together, creating quite a hefty, sturdy case.

The upsides of using a S-A case are that it can be very pretty, as you can use transluscent acrylic to create a diffusion effect for LEDs, and the board will feel very sturdy to type on, similar to a case with a brass weight in. It also comes with a large amount of customisabilty, as you can design your own if you have the time and knowledge.

The downsides, in my opinion, outwiegh the upsides, in their sheer number and importance. Firstly, the acrylic used will always be very wasteful, because to make the wide and deep, but thin case walls will create lots of unusable (other than for very small projects) material in the middle. Also, acrylic is quite dense for plastic but is also very brittle, meaning that it is far from portable. Any boards larger than a 35-40% with an acrylic case will be too heavy to carry around, and you would have to be careful not to place it down too hard on a table as there is a chance you would split one of the layers. Finally, acrylic is one of the more expensive case materials, meaning that all of the possible S-A cases will cost a fairly significant amount more than an injection moulded polycarbonate case of the same size.
