There are a number of different 'mounts' for a keyboard. This refers to how the plate and pcb are connected to the case. It mostly has an effect on the fell of typing, though it can sometimes affect the sound profile of the board. [This website](https://www.keyboard.university/200-courses/keyboard-mounting-styles-4lpp7) has some nice graphics showing the mounts as described below.

### Tray Mount
Tray mount is the most common mount for a keyboard. It is the cheapest, and just involves mounting the plate and pcb to the case using stand-offs. It will often have a harsh feel when bottoming out a switch, and can amplify the rattle sound of the stabilisers if they havent been well lubed. The O ring mod is a subsection of tray mounting that can be very beneficial to the feel of the board.


### Sandwhich Mount
Sandwhich mount is a slightly more complicated mounting system, and involves the plate being held between the top and bottom housings of the keyboard. It therefore costs more, and is mostly used for higher end boards where aesthetics are very important, as it provides very little difference in feel to a tray mounted board.

### Top and Bottom Mount
Top mounting is the method of screwing the plate into the top housing of the board, allowing a small amount of plate flex. Bottom mount is identical to the top mount, except the plate is attached to the bottom housing rather than the top.

### Gasket Mount
This is becoming increasingly popular within the community for its superior feel and sound over other mounting styles. It involves the plate resting on a cushioning gasket material, similar to the sandwhich mount but less harsh. It allows the bottom out to feel more squishy, and slightly mutes the sound of the board by reducing vibrations.
