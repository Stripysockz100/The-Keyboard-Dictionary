O rings split opinions quite heavily in the mechanical keyboard community. They have a somewhat small dedicated user group, and the rest of the community hates those pesky rebber rings. 

They are placed on the under side of the keycap, around the circular stem holder, and provide som cushioning when bottoming out a switch as they are less dense than the plastic in the bottom of the switch. 

This is in theory a good idea, and the dedicated user group agrees with its intended purpose, and genuinely like how they feel, but the rest of the community that have tried them know that they just make the switch feel less satisfying and just take away from the feel of the switch. Their accidental secondary use is in the O ring mod in tray mounted boards.
