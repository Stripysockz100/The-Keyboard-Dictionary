### Legend application
There are 2 methods of adding *legends* to a keycap.

Dye-sub (short for dye-sublimation) is the process by which a special type of ink is applied to a keycap using heat and pressure. This often produces less clear legends, which can sometimes look smudged or have messy endings. This is typically the cheaper and lower quality option for keycap manufacture.

Double-shot keycaps, as the name suggests, are keycaps with 2 colours of plastic used for the legend and cap itself. This often produces a higher quality legend with very little smudging or smearing around the edge of the legend. This is of course more expensive as it requires more complex machines and more plastic to be used, however I believe it to be worth the small premium you pay.

### Colour options
Depending on the vendor, profile, and material, there will be a fairly varied selection of coloured and monochrome sets.

It is very easy to find a set of BoW (black legends on white caps) or WoB (white legends on black caps) from most keycap vendors as these are the most standard colour scheme and will fit with most colours of board. On the oposite end of the spectrum to this, there are the multicoloured sets with up to 5 or 6 different colours in them. Any keycap vendor will have at least a few of these keycap sets to pick a scheme that fits you build. A well recommended and in stock keycap manufacturer is Akko: they have lots of colour themes (some seemingly more random than others), and they have very clean looking WoB and BoW sets.

### Pudding keycaps
These are a special type of keycap that are often used on boards that are designed to be very RGB heavy. They consist of a clear plastic keycap, partially coated in white or black palstic to cover the top half of the keycap (minus the legend of course), allowing lots of RGB goodness to bleed out of the side of the keycaps, making for a very bright board. It is difficult to find higher quality pudding keycaps, as they are most frequently found on cheaper boards, as standard looks are favoured over artificial looks with LEDs in the higher end of the keyboard spectrum.
