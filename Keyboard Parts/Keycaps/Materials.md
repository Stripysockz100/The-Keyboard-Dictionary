### ABS
ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) is a form of fairly brittle plastic, often used as the pastic in injection moulding many household items. It is sometimes associated with being low quality, though this changes between products. It is the more common plastic used for making keycaps as it is on the cheaper end of plastics.

### PBT
PBT is considered to be a high quality plastic for making keycaps, though it comes at a larger price. It will often be injection moulded into thicker keycaps, often giving it a 'thockier' and deeper sound.


### Which is better?
ABS is used by GMK keycaps (one of the generally accpeted best keycap manufacturers) and could therefore be considered to be better, however almost all other high quality cap sets use thick PBT.
