### Types
There are 2 main types of keycap profile: unique/sculpted, and uniform. Sculpted profiles have different key profiles for each row, whereas uniform profiles have a single profile that is used on every row of the board

### Unique
The main types of unique profile are cherry, dsa, and SA. Cherry is the most common profile for keycap sets sp will have the most options for colours and themes, and is a fairly middle ground profile, as it isn't particularly tall or short, however it can cause problems when using boards with north facing LEDs.
DSA profile caps are less common than cherry profile caps, as they have a more unique feel. They are thinner, aiming to seem more similar to a laptop keyboard, which can be nice for some but feel wierd for others.
SA profile caps are even more polarising as they are comparatively very tall, have a slightly smaller top, and have much more sculpting/curvature. This can give a very satisfying retro feel, but can also cause wrist pain without a wrist rest. 

### Uniform 
Uniform sets are often chosen for people who dont mind a more simplistic approach to their board, or by users who want to try out different layouts which require different keys on different rows and therefore sculpted keys would all be misaligned and on the wrong rows.

The main uniform profile is XDA. It is a fairly mediocre profile and has nothing special or particularly bad about it, but it just sort of exists and a few sets use it.
