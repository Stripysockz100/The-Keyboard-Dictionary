There are 3 main keycap 'mounting styles': MX, Alps, and choc.

Mx stems are the most common, they are the cross stem looking caps.

Alps are fairly uncommon switches as they aren't used much so caps are quite hard to find for them. If you do get your hands on them though, they need the rectangular stem keycap stems.

The final style is the choc system. These are only used on the Kailh choc low profile switches, and they use 2 protruding tabs that slot into the female side on the switch (by contrast to the other mounting styles)
