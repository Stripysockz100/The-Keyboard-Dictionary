Linear switches are the most readily available type of switch, leading to a very wide range of paramaters. Linears are exactly what you think they would be: smooth with no bump. As with all switches, there are 2 main things to think about when buying switches: the spring weight and the sound profile.

Spring weights vary greatly, from around 35 grams up to about 80 grams. The weight you choose will be based entirely around how strong your fingers are and what feels nice to type on. It's difficult to know what you will like without trying different switches. The best way to address this problem is by either buying a switch tester with a selection of switch types and weights, or by going to a meetup and testing out different boards and switches.

The linear switch market is massively over-saturated, meaning that you won't have a particularly hard time finding the right switch for you.

There is a special type of linear switch called silent linears, which yet again are exactly what you would expect them to be: linear switches that are much quieter. They differ primarily in materials, where the bottom of the stem has a small piece of rubber attached to it to dampen the noise and bottom out feel of the switch. Very few people use these switches though, because they feel very mushy and remove the satisfying feeling of bottoming out the switch.

The most common types of linear switch are reds and blacks, where blacks normally have have heavier springs (though this of course differs between manufacturers).
