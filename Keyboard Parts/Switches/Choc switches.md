Choc switches are quite unique in that they are very low profile, and are basically only used in ergo boards. They use a different mounting style so aren't compatible with MX keycaps, but there are some keycaps available, mostly manufactured by MBK. 

As opposed to most mx switches which have 4 or 3.2cm travel, choc switches have a 3cm travel, which therefore means they take less long to actuate, and are more gentle on your fingers.

The choc range of switches is suprisingly varied given how new the concept is and how limiting the form factor is, as there is a large range of weights of linear switch and a few tactile and clicky variants too.

Choc switches are manufactured by Kailh industries and are the most common type of low profile mechanical keyboard switch, however there are other types of low profile switches that mimmick the 'scissor' action of laptop keyboards.
