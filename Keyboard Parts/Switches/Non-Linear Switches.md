### Tactile Switches
Tactile switches are the leact commonly used type of switch because they don't have the smooth travel of a linear and they lack the satisfying click of a clicky switch. However, tactile users see the benefits elsewhere: you get the feedback from the switch as to when the keypress has been registered, and one of the lesser talked about benefits of tactile switches is their ability to cover up for bad or non-existent modding, as the bump masks a surprisingly large quantity of case ping or stabiliser rattle.

The most common type of tactile is the brown switch, which as any enthusiast will tell you, is less than desirable in a higher end board, so tactile switches are much better when not bought as part of a generalised category, and are much higher quality when bought from a vendor that doesn't mass produce all types of switch (basically holy pandas over cherry browns).

### Clicky switches
Clicky switches all sound very similar, only differing in how loud the click is: different pitches of click aren't really an option. The only real exception to this rule is the kailh box jades which have a click on both the compression and depression.

The main types of clicky switch are blues, greens, and whites, all of which are fairly indistinguishable except from spring weight.
