### Overview
The sound profile of a board is determined by a large number of factors, so there is no guarantee that altering one aspect will completely revolutionise the profile.

That being said, the main aspects of the sound profile are:
- The keyswitches being used
- The Case material and mounting style
- The PCB material
- The modifications you have made to the board

I have gone into more detail about these aspects individually in the respective sections, so this page will look at some general sound profiles you could aim towards.


### Thocky
This term is thrown around in the community so much it is almost meaningless now. In broad terms it refers to make the board sound deeper and slightly more muted, a goal that a large number of enthusiasts are still aiming towards.

### Muted
This is exactly what it says on the tin: making the board sound quieter and less obtrusive, often beneficial for users in a shared working space.

### Clacky
Making a board sound clacky is pretty much as far from thocky as is possible. It involves making the board lound and obnoctious but still not sound scratchy, and can quite easily be achived with the right switches.

### Poppy
Poppy is a difficult term to give a definition to as some people use it interchangeaby with clacky, but I will define its other use here. It is when a board sounds un-finished, without mods such as case foam or lubing switches, an all round undesirable state.
