### General Principles for materials
- All metals will sound more 'pingy' than plastics and will create a higher pitched sound profile
- All metals will however feel more 'premium' than a plastic board
- Most plastics will have a more muted, lower pitched sound profile 
- This however comes at the cost of the board sometimes feeling lower quality

### Case materials
- Aluminium will always sound pingy unless it is heavily modded
- POM/Polycarbonate will sound quiter than most materials but might feel weaker and often won't look as nice, however it will normally offer the most colour options
- Stacked acrylic boards have very varied sound profiles based on the quality of manufacture and thickness. See the dedicated page for more
- Brass weights in keyboards don't effect the sound of the board, they just add weight and make the board feel more 'premium'

### Plate materials
- POM/Polycarbonate allows the most colour options (though this is only relevant if you want a clear plate for RGB shine-through) and will sound fairly muted though can sometimes be rattley. It will however provide the most 'squishy' bottom out as it is more flexible than the other materials
- FR4/carbon fibre will sound the most muted, though some consider it to be too muted. It has a fairly neutral bottom out feel as it is somewhat stiff but not painfully so
- Aluminium plates are a fairly standard way of getting something you won't hate if you aren't sure because they have a fairly middleground sound profile and feel 
- Brass plates are the opposite of FR4: they are high pitched, comparatively very 'pingy', and quite harsh in terms of flexibility.
