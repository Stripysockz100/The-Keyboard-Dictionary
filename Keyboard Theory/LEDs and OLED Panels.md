### LEDs
LEDs are an important part of any board for some, but many find them       irritating or invasive of the board's aesthetic. 
The brightness of the board's LED's is based off a number of factors: whether the LED's are north or south facing, the quality of the LED's, and the switches and keycaps being used.

I have gone into some detail about LEDs on the PCBs page but I will go into more detail about the directions here. North and south facing refers to the orientation of the LED on the PCB: whether it is at the top or bottom (I assume you can work out which is which). North facing is chosen because it provides more light shine through for shine-through keycaps however it can cause interference with some keycaps so always check compatability when choosing a keycap set. South facing LEDs won't cause compatability issues however they are noticably less bright.

### Colours
There are 2 common types of LED colouring options for boards: RGB and uni-colour. They are both fairly self explanatory so I won't go into more detail than that.

The other important aspect of a board to consider when thinking about LEDs is the addresability: per-key RGB vs whole board. In both cases you can change the colours of all the LEDs (if it's an RGB board), but per-key RGB allows each LED to be changed individually, and whole board RGB only allows you to change the colours of all the LEDs at the same time.
### OLED screens
OLED panels/screens are the little blue displays you can see on some boards. They serve no obvious purpose and all boards can function without it but they can be a nice litte gimick or addition to a board, just because.

They can be used to display your active words per minute, your recent key presses, a small animation, or in the case of ergo-boards, what layer you are in.
