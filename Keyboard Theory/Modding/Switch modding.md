### Lubricating switches
Depending on what switches are being used, different lubricating methods should be used:

Linear switches should be heavily lubed using 205 grade 0. Lube all over the stem, including on the legs (excluding the crosspiece obviously). lube the bottom housing (including in and around the pin holder), but don't lube the leaf (metal connectors) as this might break the switch. The line between underlubed and overlubed isn't particularly fine but it will be very clear if you have under or over done a part of a switch.

Tactile and clicky switches should be lubed in a fairly similar manner with 205G0 : not too much, and definately none on the legs of the stem as this will diminish the tactility of the switch, and yet again no lube on the leaf.

Choc switches are fairly different in their lubing sequence: only a small amount of lube should be applied to the bottom housing, with more lube focused towards the stem and the top housing. As well as this, very slim pieces of tape can be stuck to the inside of the top housing to reduce rattle (there are plenty of tutorials on youtube as to how to do this, this description isn't nearly accurate enough to describe the process). This tape addition can take quite some time, though it is definately worth it.

### Switch films
Films are added to switches to reduce rattle. As the name suggests, they are a thin piece of plastic that sits between the housings of a switch. This is a very cheap and easy way to greatly improve the sound of a board.
