### The 'O ring' mod
The 'O ring' mod is most commonly used on the 'tofu' boards from KBDfans as it is one of a diminishing number of 'higher end' boards that still use the 'Tray Mount' mounting style. 

This mod consists of using O rings, a small ring of silicone or rubber placed over keycap inside stem holder, but instead of placing them in a keycap as they were intended to be used, the mod dictates that you place the O ring over the screw being used to mount the pcb and plate to the case. This O ring then acts like a gasket strip on a high end gasket mounted board as it its what the pcb predominantly rests on, and therefore as it is less dense than the metal or plastic standoff, it absorbs more of the pressure from the bottom out, giving a less harsh typing feel. 

This is of course all wonderful in theory, however on many tray mount boards, the screws arent long enough to allow the O ring to be seated with enough space to compress, and quite often, the O rings aren't squishy enough to have a large effect on the feel of typing as bottoming out a keypress is so swift of an action that the finger barely registers it anyway.

### The Tape mod
The tape mod is a very cheap and simple way of altering the sound profile of a keyboard. As with everything in this hobby, doing the tape mod comes down to your preference as it is somewhat a 'marmite mod' in that it splits opinions.

The mod consists of applying layers of painters tape or masking tape to the bottom of the PCB. This has a surprisingly large effect on the sound of the board: it will (for some reason) make the board sound more 'poppy'. Of course the type of tape and how many layers of tape used will affect the difference made to the sound of the board. 

If you are thinking of doing this mod, i would recommend watching some youtube videos about the mod and listenening to their sound tests as this will help you gauge what paramaters you might use when doing the mod. 

### The Foam mod
This mod is very standard and is reommended by everyone who has ever done it because of how life-changing it is in terms of making the board sound nicer.

The foam mod is as simple as cutting up some foam (packing foam or any similar absorbant material) and jamming as much of it as is possible into the base of the keyboard (between the pcb and the inside bottom of the case). This then absorbs lots/all of the pinging sound from the case as it both dampens the case vibrations and absorbs sound vibrations coming off the back of the PCB. This therefore removes any hollowness from the sound of the board, a very highly commended aspect for a board.

It's quite difficult to go wrong when it comes to this mod as there is no such thing as too much foam in a board (unless it is physically damaging a part of the board like bending the pcb or case), so basically just go for it no matter what. 

### The PCB Foam mod
This mod has a very similar premise to the foam mod (above) as it aims to reduce vibrations and hollowness. Helpfully, this mod is sometimes done by the manufacturer (depending on how quality the board is) as otherwise it can be quite tedious.

The mod consists of a fairly thin layer of foam being placed between the plate and PCB, preventing rattle between the 2, and dampenening any vibrations. This foam has holes for all of the switches to fit through.

If PCB foam is not provided by the manufacturer, in some cases you can just place a layer of foam with no holes in between the plate and PCB and jam the switches into through it, just make sure the switch has clicked into the plate before moving on to the next (if you are going to do this, watch a tutorial on youtube because I dont want to be at fault for a few broken switches or a popped-out hotswap socket)

### The Silicone Pour mod
This is a much more advanced mod and isn't recommended for beginners. It basically does the same as the foam mod just a bit better, at the cost of a lot more time, money, and possible damage, so watch plenty of tutorials if you are going to attempt this and make sure you fully understand the process. But for now, here it is in (somewhat) brief.

This mod consists of (as the name suggests) pouring a thick layer of silicone into the bottom of a case to dampen it from vibrations and reduce hollowness. Before you pour the silicone however, you must do a few prelimenary steps: check that the board is completely water tight (this can be checked by carefully pouring water into the case and seeing if/where it leaks. Remove all electrical parts before doing this obviously!), some boards already will be, but any gaps can be covered with a few layers of painters/masking tape. Next clean the board with either a disinfectant wipe or a clean cloth and some isopropyl alcohol to ensure that nothing gets stuck in the case, trapped in the silicone, then finally leave it out to dry until you are sure that there is absolutely no moisture in the case. 
The silicone composite can be made from a 2-part kit that binds on contact with each other after a couple of hours, which can be bought from any hobby craft store or online. Simply mix the 2 parts in a cup and stir with a disposable rod of some form (wooden coffee stirer or clean lollipop stick), then pour the mixture into the case, making sure before hand that the case is STABLE and on a FLAT SURFACE so that silicone doesnt leak out of the sides. Leave this however long the packet of silicone parts says plus a bit (i would recommend over night) before doing anything to it. Just make sure you don't pour so much silicone that you can't then fit the PCB back in the case.

Basically this mod is really complicated, and while it makes the board sound better, it is a great example of the law of diminishing returns, as it poses the question 'Is it worth the extra day you spend making the board for a comparatively minimal change (over no mods vs foam mod compared to foam mod vs silicone pour)?'
