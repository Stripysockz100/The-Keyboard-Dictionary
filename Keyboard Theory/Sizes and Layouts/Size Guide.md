There are 5 main standard board sizes: 60%, 65%, 75%, TKL, and 100%. The percentage refers to roughly what percentage of the keys remain in comparison with a 100% board. 

100% is the standard office keyboard. It has a full set of alphanumeric, symbol and mod keys, as well as a function row, a navigation cluster (home, end, delete etc.), arrow keys, and a num pad, (and sometimes a media cluster with volume controls). It has every key you could possibly need and more, and is very useful for data entry or office jobs because of all the possible keys, but falls short when gaming because of its large size minimising mouse movement space.

TKL (ten key-less) boards are the exact same layout as 100% boards, but without the numpad. This means they maintain lots of functionality while massively increasing mouse space.

75% and 65% are very similar in nature, as they contain all keys any gamer could need, and most that any typeist might need. They both contain the alphanumeric, symbol, mod keys, and arrow keys, but they differ from TKLs in that the nav cluster is condensed and flattened to the side of the main body of keys, reducing the size again for very little loss of keys. 65% and 75% differ however in that 75% boards have a functio row, and 65% boards don't.

60% is probably the most common size for mechanical keyboards as it only contains the keys required to do minimal typing, maximising mouse space. This much smaller layout often uses layers to allow for all required keys to be accessed.

There is no 1 best size, as everyone uses keyboards for different things. A writer might prefer a 100% for its widely accessible range of keys, whereas a gamer might prefer a 60 or 65% board for the extra mouse space and to cut down on unnecessary cost of unnecessary keys.
