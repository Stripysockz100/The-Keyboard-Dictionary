### The History of Qwerty and why it is the norm
Qwerty is recognised as the national standard layout for keyboards in all English speaking countries and many other languages too, but why?

It origionates back to the ancient technology of the typewriter, the predecessor to the keyboard. The designers of the typewriter needed a way to stop all of the levers jamming together so frequently, so they moved common letter pairs (called bigrams) that could get jammed as far away from each other. This is what the qwerty layout does: spreads out the keys so bigrams are as far away from each other as is generally possible. 

As it was the generally accepted layout for typewriters, when the world started making the move to digital keyboards, manufacturers needed to get users off to what the user thought was a flying start so that their products would be globally accepted as quickly as possible. This meant that the keyboard manufacturers only had one choice: keep the qwerty layout from the typewriters. As there was no sudden change from typewriters to digital keyboards, the digital keyboards had to remain compatible and therefore was no way of moving to a more ergonomic general layout, so qwerty just sort of stuck around.
This argument is mainly held within the Ergonomic Mechanical Keyboard community as it is more based around the ergonomics of a board rather than how it sounds/feels/looks.

### Dvorak
Dvorak is a layout considered to be on the more ergonomic side due to its bigram compatability (how likely you will be able to type a bigram comfortably with consecutive fingers) and the fact that is sculpted with the english language in mind. Despite all of this, Dvorak isn't considered one of the few '*endgame*' layouts for one main reason: it's just not the best at all the things it's good at.
This leads perfectly onto the next layout...

### Colemak-DH
Although similar to Dvorak in its aim to improve bigram compatability, Colemak-DH is just considered to be one of the best fairly standard looking layouts, an endgame for many.
The two main benefits of Colemak-DH are the use of home-row optimisation and comparatively high bigram compatability. If you look at the home row of a qwerty board, you find neither of the 2 most common letters 'e' and 't', but you do find 'f', 'g','h','j', and 'k', all fairly uncommon letters. This seems illogical doesn't it. Colemak puts 'a', 'r', 's', and 't' all under the left hand fingers' home positions, which just sounds more logical, even if you have no knowledge of keyboards.
As I mentioned, Colemak has one of the highest bigram compatability score of any layout (even the AI generated ones) which makes it look very promising to people who might want to try out a new layout. The only downside of Colemak is how different it is to qwerty in comparison with Dvorak, however if you are going to put in the many hours it takes to learn a new layout, this shouldn't matter.

### Neo
This layout was developed for the german language (as is clearly shown by the umlaut characters), however with a few small modifications can be very elegant for the english language too. I wouldn't recommend it to native english speakers however it is always an option.
### So is it worth switching?
It depends on 2 things: are you willing/do you have the time to learn a new layout (bearing in mind this can take months to get back to your current speed), and is it worth changing/is there enough benefit in you changing to justify the time spent.

If you are going to switch, the earlier you do it, the better (in terms of years, months/days wont affect anything), as when you are younger your mind learns and adapts faster, which is vital for breaking qwerty muscle memory and learning a new layout. 

I would personally only recommend switching if you type for more than an hour or so a day. For instance a barber/hair dresser who doesn't use computers much would gain nothing from switching layouts, whereas a software engineer who programs for 8 hours a day and then games all evening would benefit very heavily from changing layouts as all layouts that are classed as 'better/more ergonomic than qwerty' will help to reduce RSI in the wrists.
