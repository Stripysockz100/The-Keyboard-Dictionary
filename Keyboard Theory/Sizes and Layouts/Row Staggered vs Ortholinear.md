Row stagger stems back to the typewriter days. The rows needed to be staggered against each other to allow the levers to function. This was clearly not done for ergonomics, as fingers don't naturally all extend a bit to the left, but it still stuck around with almost all boards. Row stagger is different to splay however, as discussed on a dedicated page in the ergo section.

Like with the qwerty layout, to allow for the users to make a quick transition from typewriters to digital keyboards, new manufacturers needed to change as little as possible, also allowing more experienced users to keep their typing speed high. And because humans as a general being are incapable of large scale change, the stagger has just stuck around.

Ortholinear is by no means a new concept, there are concept boards from companies like Apple and Cherry who have ortho boards, but it is only seeing a big boom (comparatively) in recent years, now that people are looking at human ergonomics. It is a very simple concept, as all it achieves is moving the keys into a pure grid, so that all rows are in line, and the same with the rows, allowing the fingers to more comfortably extend to reach the keys.
