This as a beginner/intermediate guide to everything you could want to know about keyboards. The pages are all linked for ease of use, and you can use the search function. There is a glossary of useful terms that aren't self explanatory. The terms will be *in italix* like this if they are in the glossary. 

I know from first hand experience that as a beginner, you get lots of information thrown at you without much explanation, assuming that you are an expert. I would by no means consider myself an expert either but here I have collated some useful knowledge about everything keyboard related in the hopes that it might help the newcomers to this hobby with finding their feet.

This is a free resource that I have put together as a solo project, meaning there will be many errors in what I have written, so if you notice anything you think I should change, there is a google forms link below where you can add your comments (or complaints!). Equally, if you think there is something that I should add here, let me know through the google form below and I will get to it as soon as possible. Finally, if you would like to personally contribute a page or section to this collation of knowledge, you can attach a link to a google doc with your text and where you would like to have it placed (I will of course give full credit where it is due).
