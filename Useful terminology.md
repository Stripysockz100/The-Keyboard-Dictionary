- Barebones kit - a kit containing a case, plate, PCB, and sometimes stabilizers, aimed at making designing a custom board slightly more intuitive.
- Geekhack - this isn't a physical thing: it's a website where you can find almost anything anyone could want to know about boards, including groupbuys and knowledge about products
- Ghosting - on cheaper boards, where no diodes are used, the current can flow through certain patterns of keyswitches, the processor detects a keypress where there wasn't one
- Travel - the distance between when the switch hasn't been pressed and when it has been bottomed out
- 1u/2u/Nu - the u after a number in terms of keycaps is in reference to the 'units' of space it takes up, so a normal alpha key is 1u, and any other number is the keycaps comparative size in relation to 1u
- Keymap - the firmware of your board, dictating what character is sent to the computer when you press a key or combination of keys
